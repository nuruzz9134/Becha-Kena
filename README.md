# "Becha-Kena" - An Ecommerce Platform
"Becha-Kena" is a responsive modern "Full Stack" ecommerce application with Payments functionality and P2P communication feature between buyer and seller. Recognising the barriers with individual merchants and startups against big giants' monopoly systems. I realised to build a platform where a buyer or seller can communicate or burgain on their products which facilities are not given by other usual e-commerce platforms.
